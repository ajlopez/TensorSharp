# TensorSharp

TensorFlow ideas implemented in C#, WIP

## Description

This project is an attempt to implement ideas from Google [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). It's not a compatible
tool, but a library to be used to explore the tensor operations and their composition.
The code was written using TDD (Test-Driven Development).
